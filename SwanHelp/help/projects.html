<p>In this new SWAN, there is a central concept that drives the users work: the <b>Project</b>. This is a special kind of folder where you can put your notebooks, data files, images or whatever you want.</p>
<p>This was introduced because we wanted our users to share their work right from inside SWAN. Projects are the unit of sharing in SWAN: when you share a Project you share also every file inside it.</p>
