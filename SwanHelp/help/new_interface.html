<p>The new SWAN comes with a redesigned interface. It is divided in three views, accessible by clicking on the corresponding tab:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Projects</b>: it lists your projects.</li>
    <li><b>Share</b>: it lists your shared projects and the projects shared with you.</li>
    <li><b>CERNBox</b>: it lists the files you have in your CERNBox, equivalent to what you can see in production now.</li>
</ul>
