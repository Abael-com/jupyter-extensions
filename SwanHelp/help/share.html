<p>In order to share a project with some colleague you have a few options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the Projects view, hover over a project, you will see a button appearing to share that project.</li>
    <li>If you click on a project to see the files it contains, there is a share button on the top right.</li>
    <li>When you are editing a notebook, there is a share button in the header (top right of the page).</li>
</ul>
<p>When following one of the options above, the Sharing Panel appears. Search for the names of the people you want to share with and click enter to add them to the list. Then click "Share" to start sharing.</p>
<p>When opening the Share view (clicking on the "Share" tab), you will see a list with the projects you have shared and those that others shared with you. If someone shared a project with you, you can hover over with the mouse and click on "Clone" to accept the share.</p>
<p>Please note that, when you click on "Clone", the project will appear in your project list and, consequently, all the project content will be copied to your CERNBox. Only sharing by copy is supported: Jupyter does not support yet the concurrent editing of the same notebook file by multiple people.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want a project to stop being shared, open the Share view, hover over the project and click on "Edit sharing".</p>
