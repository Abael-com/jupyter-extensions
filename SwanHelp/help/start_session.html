<p>If you are reading this guide it is because you started a SWAN session. The web form to configure your session is basically the same as in the production machines, modulo a couple of new options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Spark cluster: select a Spark cluster where to offload jobs from your notebooks. If you are not interested in Spark, just ignore this option.</li>
    <li>"Always start with this configuration": if you tick this box, we will save your choices for the next time you start a session, so that you are not prompted with the form every time you use SWAN.</li>
</ul>
