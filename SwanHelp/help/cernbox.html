<p>Please note that CERNBox is still your home directory in this new interface! You can see your CERNBox content by clicking on the CERNBox view.</p>
<p>All your projects are located in the "SWAN_projects" folder inside your CERNBox. You can actually treat projects as normal folders too, and copy files to/from your projects.</p>
